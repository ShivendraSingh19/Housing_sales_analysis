# Real Estate Housing Price Analysis and Prediction

#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The data and its structure are examined, including distributions of key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of floors.
Relationships between house prices and various features are visualized to uncover patterns and insights relevant to price prediction.

#### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Missing data is handled, and outliers are removed to ensure accurate modeling.
Data normalization and feature engineering are applied to improve the quality and usability of the dataset.

#### 3. Feature Selection:
The correlation between features and house prices is analyzed to determine the most significant predictors.
Statistical methods and visualizations are used to ensure only relevant features are included for model building.

#### 4. Model Building:
A regression model is developed to predict house prices based on selected features.
Linear Regression and other algorithms are employed for creating the model.

#### 5. Model Evaluation:
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure the robustness and reliability of the model.

#### 6. Predictions:
The model is utilized to predict house prices based on the given attributes, offering insights that can inform decision-making in residential real estate investments.
